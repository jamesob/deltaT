;; post date juggling 
;; ------------------
;;
;;   Since there's no standard indicator of when a file was first created, we have
;;   to do something a little ugly: manually track when txture has first seen a
;;   post.
;;
;;   We do this by keeping a ``secret dates'' file, which tracks, for each post,
;;   when that post entered the blog and when it was last modified.
;;
;;   ``Why track the last modification in a file? We already have that information
;;   from Java.'' We record the last time a file was modified because then we can
;;   implement some stupid caching scheme later that compares the .lastModified
;;   property of a post's file with our `*secret-date-file*`'s to see if we
;;   should reload the post data.
