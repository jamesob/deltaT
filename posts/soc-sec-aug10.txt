title: Social security finally dragging its wagon
labels: social security, welfare, armchair economics

From a cute article in <a
href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-great-stock-myth/8178/1/">The
Atlantic</a>:

<blockquote><p>For decades, pundits have been warning that a time
would come when Social Security would start to become a drain on the
federal budget. Now it's happening. In 2010, for the first time, payouts to
retirees and the disabled have exceeded the program's revenues from payroll
taxes. Infusions from the general fund are now needed if the government is to
keep mailing checks---a situation that is projected to become a permanent, and
growing, problem by 2016.

<p>That means that Social Security, too, is exposed to the performance of the
stock market. Unfortunately, unlike the holders of 401(k) accounts, the
beneficiaries are not aware of this, which means that they will not, for
example, delay retirement until the market recovers. (In fact, Social
Security is thought to cause older Americans to retire before they
otherwise would.)</blockquote>

I found the tone of the article hand-wavy, but it 
did prompt me to a few observations.

<h3>Lackluster performance in this decade's equities market</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXSP:.INX">
        Google Finance's page for the S&P 500</a>
    <li>Set ``zoom'' to 10y.
    <li>Notice that the equities market has floundered around for the past
    decade; we are lower than we were in 2000.
    <li>Slide the window around to previous decades, e.g. '90-'00, '80-'90, etc.
    Notice an upward trend in each of them.

</div>
    <li>Notice the similarity between the seventies (Nixon-Ford-Carter) and now.
</ol>

Google Finance only offers a limited window of comparison. More
telling might be to look at the '20s and '30s.

<h3>Social Security is a leaky abstraction</h3>

<p>The primary message of the above article is that Americans shouldn't
necessarily expect a generous return (5-9% <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>) from the
equities market despite the fact that, historically, that's what we've been
given. This is a valid, almost trivial, claim: precise future predictions
from historical observations are prone to error. What does this have to do with
social security?

<p>A problem with social security is that it's a leaky abstraction, meaning that
while it claims to relieve Americans of the strenuous task of figuring out how
and where to save their money for retirement, it does not do so in a complete or
even desirable way. When you buy into social security, you necessarily buy the
idea that the government knows best or, on average, better how to predict the
future and invest assets accordingly. 

<p>To force this presumption on Americans is embarrassing and ineffective.
Ineffective? Note this excerpt from Wikipedia <a href="#fn0">[0]</a>:
<blockquote>
    [C]ritics point out [118] that under the Social Security laws as they
    existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas
    were allowed to opt out of the Social Security program in the early 1980s,
    and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While
    employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month
    in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month.
</blockquote>
Is this an anecdote? Yes. Is it conclusive, scientific fact that private plans
always and forever beat out social security? By no means. Is it an incidence
worth considering because it alludes to the reality that an individual can
outperform the government by leaps and bounds? Absolutely.

<p>If the <i>Atlantic</i> writer quoted above is right, and there are financial
concussions ahead in the equities market, you can bet there are people
aware of this. If retirement investing were left to the individual, he could
start hedging against cataclysms in the equities market by buying commodities or
looking to foreign markets. Social security says, ``just shut up and leave it to
me,'' as it finances America's towering deficit  by purchasing US bonds
<a href="#fn3">[3]</a>.


<h3>Wikipedia is full of shit</h3>

<p>The word ``insurance'' is used 48 times in the Wikipedia article on American
social security <a href="#fn0">[0]</a>. Frequently, an author of the Wikipedia 
article describes social security as a type of insurance; this definition
is then used as a false basis for shooting down unflattering comparisons to
private retirement plans.
                                                                     
<p>Social security is not an insurance. Insurance is a tool used to hedge
against risk; retirement is an eventuality, not a disaster. Apple's dictionary
defines insurance as ``a thing providing protection against a possible
eventuality''. Retirement is not a possible eventuality: statistically, it is
almost a surety <a href="#fn4">[4]</a>. Just as pursuing life insurance after
you've been diagnosed with cancer is ridiculous, so too is calling social
security a type of insurance.

<p>The reason an insurance policy can work in spite of inflation is because not
all policy holders will ever cash in; in fact, often since the risk being hedged
against by the policy holder is remote, only a minority ever see any benefit
from taking out insurance. If you consider social security an insurance, you're
necessarily saying that the overwhelming majority of policy holders will cash
in, which reduces the social security fund to a leaky well used for long-term
water storage.

<p>Imagine insurance as a giant pool of water. When someone takes out a policy,
they put a small amount of their own water into the giant pool on a regular
basis. When someone covered under the insurance falls victim to the risk they've
hedged against by taking out a policy, they take out a(n often much) larger
portion of water than they've put in to mitigate damages they've experienced.

<p> The giant pool, though, is evaporating at some rate because of inflation (an
average of 1.929% per year <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>) and some water is lost in the
process of removing it from the pond (overhead). These losses are worth it,
though, because many people want to gamble against some awful, unlikely fate.

<p>If you consider social security an insurance, most everyone who contributes
water to the pond will <i>again withdrawal</i> their share. Because of the
massive number of withdrawals, the amount of water lost during withdrawal
becomes egregious. It's a system that doesn't make any sense for the needs of
contributors.

<h3>Alternatives</h3>

<p>Perhaps some Americans do benefit from the government controlling a portion
of their assets for retirement because they're incapable themselves. Instead of
every citizen involuntarily surrendering a percentage of their income, those who
feel the government does a better job could <b>elect</b> to place their money
under governmental control. 

<p>Oh wait; but then when returns offered by the government are dwarfed by
private equivalents, as in the Texan case above, the program will shrivel and
collapse, just as the public school system would if citizens were offered
vouchers for private education. Why interrupt a perfectly good stream of
mediocrity?

<p>Of course, these observations are moot anyway: most sensible reform is
infeasible because of the baby-boomers' entitlement to my generation's money.
And so on. And so on.

<p>Isn't the future bright.
