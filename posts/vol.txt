:title: Fixing poor volume adjustment in Lucid Lynx (Master vs. PCM)
:labels: volume, ubuntu lucid, master, pcm

<p>I recently updated my Ubuntu installation to Lucid Lynx and I noticed funky behavior in the volume adjustment. It seems in Lynx that changing the volume of the Master channel results in poor volume adjustment; the lowest 20% of the volume bar is where all of the change in amplitude happens.

<p>Through some testing with alsamixer, I figured the channel I really wanted to be tweaking is PCM. How do we change adjustment of volume to default to PCM instead of master? Here's a workaround.

<p>Crack open <span id="inline-code">/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common</span> and look for the following lines:

<pre>[Element PCM]
switch = mute
volume = merge
override-map.1 = all
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right</pre>

Add these lines before
<pre>
[Element Master]
switch = mute
volume = ignore
</pre>
and these after
<pre>
[Element LFE]
switch = mute
volume = ignore
</pre>

This results in
<pre>
[Element Master]
switch = mute
volume = ignore

[Element PCM]
switch = mute
volume = merge
override-map.1 = all
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

[Element LFE]
switch = mute
volume = ignore
</pre>

Save/quit, restart. Yanked from <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8314847&postcount=4">here</a>.
