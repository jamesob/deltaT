{:title "xsession fail"
 :labels (list "xsession", "xinitrc")}

<p>In Ubuntu 10.04, modifying or creating <span class="inline-code">
.xinitrc</span>/<span class="inline-code">.xsession</span> does a sweet nothing.
Instead, you have to use <span class="inline-code">.xsessionrc</span>. Ubuntu
doesn't mind ignoring Linux standards, I guess.

<p>I'm kinda pining for Arch.
